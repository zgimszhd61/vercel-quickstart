This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## QUICKSTART
Here is a quickstart guide for getting started with Vercel:

## Install Vercel CLI

First, install the Vercel CLI globally:

```bash
pnpm install -g vercel
```

## Create a New Project

1. Create a new directory for your project:

```bash
mkdir my-vercel-app
cd my-vercel-app
```

2. Initialize a new project with your preferred frontend framework. For example, to create a new Next.js app:

```bash
pnpm create next-app@latest .
```

## Deploy to Vercel

1. Log in to Vercel from the CLI:

```bash
vercel login
```

2. Initialize a new Vercel project:

```bash
vercel init
```

3. Deploy your project to Vercel:

```bash
vercel
```

This will build and deploy your app to a unique URL. Vercel will show you the deployment URL in the CLI output.

## Develop Locally

To develop your app locally, you can use the development server provided by your frontend framework. For Next.js:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Your local development server will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deploy Changes

After making changes to your project, you can deploy the updates by simply running:

```bash
vercel --prod
```

This will build and deploy your updated project to the same URL as before.[1][2]
